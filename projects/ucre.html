              <p class="x-large-text">
              Pittsburgh public art strengthens citizens' connection to their city and invites visitors and residents alike to share in a common experience. Public art's open form - not confined to a museum or paid exhibition - is what makes public art accessible to all. <br><br>To measure engagement and encourage people to learn more about pieces in Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon partnered with the Metro21: Smart Cities Institute to understand ways in which the integration of technology could gauge and create interest in public art.
              <br>
              <br>In this project, user research was key to understanding user goals and motivations through various interview methods. This project was two part. To understand the context, the project evolved with individual and team research. <u>Part 1: Individual Research</u> focused on generating insight into why people choose to spend time with art and considered past efforts to encourage people to do so. <u>Part 2: Team Research</u> focused on combining individual ideas about the context, while reframing insights into ideas to test with users through interviews and prototyping.
              <br><br>
              User research led to discover where value could be added and prototyping of our idea <b>AR+</b>, an augmented reality experience, that allows users to discover city art and architecture. AR+ challenges the conventional idea of what can be considered “public art” and allows users to discover more about the history, making, and motivations behind public art.

              <p class="x-large-text">
              The purpose of background research was to generate insight into how technology may support interaction with public art. Through observational and informational research, we each visited public art pieces in Downtown Pittsburgh and conducted supplemental digital research which provided context and shaped ideas about how public art is perceived in Pittsburgh.</p>
               <p class="x-large-text">
              Observe and Intercept Interviews with people Downtown and Contextual Inquiry interviews with a city art curator and with the project sponsor, Metro21, were provided as existing data. To model the problem space and define opportunity, these interviews were analyzed individually, and notes were then aggregated as part of a group Interpretation Session.

              <h5>Analyzing Interview Data through Modeling </h5><br>
             
              <p class="x-large-text">Public art impacts the city in unique ways. On any night in Pittsburgh, it may provide leisure and a place for people to gather after stores and businesses are closed. It provides free and accessible art for people who do not have the opportunity to see exhibits due to monetary or time restraints, and may develop an interest in art for those who may not consider visiting museums. For downtown residents who live near art and see it frequently, it may deepen a sense of connection to the city. Dog owners and runners who move about the city may find art interesting and use art as landmarks to help them navigate.<br><br>

                In modeling stakeholders, it was important to think broadly about users and their interactions with one another. The roles of stakeholders are sometimes connected in unexpected ways. For example, building owners may have a stake in whether art is placed near their property, and people’s dogs may even be stakeholders in the long-term maintenance of art. Overlooked stakeholders could be people who do not directly contribute monetarily to the project. In major cities, overlooked stakeholders in new building construction could be homeless people the building displaces through gentrifying a neighborhood. 

              <p class="x-large-text">From the customer journey map of an interview with a Pittsburgh mother, an opportunity that arose was how to get her children curious about public art. To do so, a broad suggestion would be to make sure information is shared in a brief, fun way where the mother could engage her children easily. Based on the customer journey map activity, another factor that arose limiting engagement with art was time. Providing opportunity to engage with art nearby or while at home could encourage visitors to learn more in a comfortable setting.

              <p class="x-large-text">
               Usability Findings Templates (UFTs) were used to frame difficulty users experienced when asked to perform tasks using the Metro21 website. From watching Think Aloud interviews of users navigating the website, we observed common problems users faced. Applying the UFTs led to realizing overarching usability themes and recommendations. </p>

               <h5>Visualizing Trends in Interactions with Public Art</h5>
               <br>
               <p class="x-large-text">Technology-based platforms were previously leveraged by Carnegie Mellon in partnership with Metro21. A campaign was run and data was collected about how users engaged with public art through social media ads (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook), QR codes that directed users to Metro21 webpages, and from questions asked to Metro21's chatbot designed to answer questions about public art. 
                <br><br><u> Method of analysis</u>:
                Tableau, a common data tool, was used for data visualization. Data sets were analyzed which contained web server logs of user interactions and user specific data (e.g. area code, device type).
                <!-- <br><br> -->
              <p class="x-large-text">
              <!-- <u>Findings</u>: I was surprised that over the course of a week, engagement was not proportionately higher on weekends compared to weekdays. This surprise was because my assumption that events in the city like shows and sports games (collegiate and professional) likely occur on weekends and I had anticipated more visitors to take notice of public art during this time. Likewise, I saw professionals and students have more time for leisure on the weekends which I assumed would translate to added web traffic for public art.

              Through analysis of chatbot data alone, I wished I had additional, observed information on user engagement to understand why users chose to ask certain questions. Additionally, when looking at Snapchat data, it would have been useful to understand what users did with filters to understand reach through looking why users sharing public art. -->
              
              <br><u>Key takeaway from data analysis:</u> From data alone, we can measure individual action, but are limited in understanding why the action was taken or its resulting impact. Quantitative data that is looked at in parallel with user interviews can provide a better understanding about what makes public art worth sharing.

              <br><br>
              Our walk the wall activity helped our group narrow in and ask "How Might We" questions. We challenged the idea that only artists create art and that art is static. 

              <!-- Through Customer Journey Mapping, I learned that one potential factor limiting engagement with public art is people not knowing about pieces and lacking time to think about art. From analyzing interviews and through an Interpersonal Session, insights about values people attribute to public art and what people wish to learn about it were formed. I am reminded of an interview of a resident who expressed that public art creates landmarks (e.g. Magnolias and Fountains). The visitor said that public art is a means of improving the visual appeal of the community, “giving people something to look at which is interesting.”  -->

We focused on not matching notes by keywords and instead by finding common themes using "I and We" statements to frame labels and let the data tell a story.</p>

               <br>
               <p class="x-large-text">From our field research, we identified needs that helped us shape designs. We used a method called "Crazy 8's" to quickly generate ideas of how we might use technology to engage visitors with public art.
              <br><br>
              We created three storyboard scenarios to test the following needs: <br>1. More information about the art <br>2. Understanding the scale of art <br>3. Finding art based on preferences <br>4. Personal participation in art <br>5. Finding art nearby<br><br> 

               <h5>Speed Dating to Test Ideas</h5>
               <br>
               <p class="x-large-text">

              We discovered direction and realized misunderstandings through speed dating with users. As a design method, speed dating evaluates several concepts by getting user feedback and reactions to the concepts. We expected that art coming to life by talking or playing music would be intriquing, but users were hesitant and interpreted the idea as creepy. We also anticipated users might be hesitant to engage with strangers, but found that people were willing to do so and were open to discussion with others in public. It was surprising how people would share an in-person experience with a stranger but were less inclined to share a digital experience with a friend. <br><br>
              Our speed dating exercise helped us hone in to augmented reality (AR) as an interesting and non-obtrustive way for users to get information about public art. <br><br>

              <h5>Why AR+?</h5>
               <br>
               <p class="x-large-text">Throughout a series of interviews, research participants expressed more interest in public art when a tailored experience was involved. <br><br>
We realized that while people don’t necessarily seek out public art, when presented with an engaging opportunity, they have an interest in learning more. They want control and autonomy in how they interact and learn about public art. There was an opportunity here to use technology to give users more control over their engagement, and to digitally transform their public art experience. <br><br>

               <h5>What is AR+?</h5>
               <br>
               <p class="x-large-text">

              We designed AR+, an augmented reality experience that allows users to personalize their journey with a piece of art. Users are able to interact directly with the art piece on their screen by clicking on “hotspots” and learning more information. This gives the user more control over their experience and engages them in a personalized way.<br><br>
The AR+ experience can even upgrade to include the architecture of the city, where users can engage with the history and context of buildings and landscapes as well. In this way, our solution also challenges and expands the conventional idea of what can be considered “public art."</p>
